read the file ./compiler-spec.md; Think step-by-step in extreme detail and create this compiler now.

1. Design your preferred output format
2. Implement the classification algorithm
3. Implement dependency analysis
4. Implement state management
5. Implement output generation with accountability
6. Implement self-description functions
7. Validate your compiler works

The compiler should be complete and self-contained. Once created, it can be saved and reused to compile any behavioral instruction set.
