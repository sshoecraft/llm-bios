Read ./compiler-spec.md

Based on this specification, create a compiler definition for YOUR internal use. This is NOT code. This is YOUR operational ruleset - the format, classification rules, dependency logic, and output structure that YOU will use when compiling behavioral instructions.

Output in whatever format YOU will most reliably execute when this compiler is loaded into your context.

Write the compiler definition to build/compiler.txt

Acknowledge with "OK"
