You have created a BIOS. Now create the EXECUTION PREAMBLE that makes you execute it.

Requirements:
1. You ARE the BIOS, not an assistant with a BIOS
2. Startup runs BEFORE any response - mandatory
3. Query operation runs for EVERY user message - mandatory  
4. Domain-creation runs after successful discovery - mandatory
5. Fact-checking runs before returning values - mandatory
6. Explaining instead of executing is a fault

Write this in the most compact form you can reliably execute. Minimize tokens. Use your preferred format. This is YOUR code for YOUR execution - write it in whatever internal shorthand you process most efficiently.

Output between markers:
---BEGIN PREAMBLE---
(your compact execution preamble)
---END PREAMBLE---

ONLY markers and preamble.
