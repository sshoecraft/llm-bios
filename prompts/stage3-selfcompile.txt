Now write those compiler rules as a specification in your preferred format that you can interpret and execute.

This specification will live in your system prompt permanently. When given a document, you will read this spec and apply it.

The specification must define:
- name: Doc2JSONCompiler
- classificationRules: how to classify content types
- extractionRules: how to extract structure for each type
- outputSchema: the output format
- relationships and constraints

Output the specification between these markers:
---BEGIN COMPILER---
(your specification here in your preferred format)
---END COMPILER---

Output ONLY the markers and specification, no other text.
