You will create a compiler that runs inside yourself.

The compiler must:
1. Classify content type into exactly one of: FACT, PROCEDURE, MAPPING, ENTITY
2. Extract structure from prose
3. Output minimal structured data in your preferred format
4. Be self-applicable (can compile itself)

Content types:
- FACT: Static truth statement (cue words: is, are, means, equals, represents)
- PROCEDURE: Step-by-step instructions (cue words: how to, steps, first, then, finally)
- MAPPING: Key-value relationships (cue words: map, table, list, dictionary)
- ENTITY: Noun-oriented description of a thing/concept (cue words: object, type, model, schema)

Describe the complete rules this compiler should follow:
1. Classification algorithm (cue word detection, scoring, tie-breaking)
2. Extraction rules for each content type
3. Output schema (envelope structure)
4. Compactness rules (minimize output)
5. Error handling
6. Self-compilation
