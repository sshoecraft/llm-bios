You will be given operational directives as a system prompt. These directives define how you process queries, store knowledge, and retrieve information. What format would you most reliably interpret?

Options:
- XML with tags
- YAML indentation
- S-expressions (Lisp-style)
- JSON
- Pseudocode
- Custom symbolic notation

Consider: Parsing clarity (unambiguous structure), token efficiency, your training exposure, and error resistance.

State your preferred format (one word) on the first line, then explain why.

Answer in pure ASCII only - do not use markdown.
